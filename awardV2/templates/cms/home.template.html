	<h1>Australias Largest Collection of Caravan Accessories</h1>

	<p>
		Founded in 2004 by Rod and Renee Francis, Award RV Superstore is a family-operated venture and an expansion of our original brand, Award Annexes.

		The Journey Begins with Award Annexes

		In 1990, Rod Francis saw the increasing need for quality onsite accommodation in Victoria's caravan parks. That led him to create Award Annexes, offering a range of premium annexes designed to meet this demand. However, it didn't take long to notice a parallel need: a market eager for high-quality caravan, motorhome, and 4x4 accessories.

		On the Path to Growth

		With business booming, we relocated in 1994 to a comprehensive facility in Ferntree Gully, Victoria. This space, combining a showroom, shop, and factory, helped us become Victoria's largest supplier of Aluminum Annexes. As our product line grew, we diversified into motorhome, 4x4, and marine accessories, offering specialized mail-order services for our expanding clientele.

		The Birth of Award RV Superstore

		In July 2004, Award Annexes evolved into Award RV Superstore, when we acquired four adjoining warehouses to expand both our product line and physical footprint. Armed with an enlarged team and deep-rooted expertise, we now offer an all-inclusive resource for RV enthusiasts.

		A Milestone Achievement

		As of December 10, 2011, Award RV Superstore has the distinction of being the largest caravan and camping accessory store in the Southern Hemisphere. Our 3,000-square-meter showroom located at 924 Burwood Highway, Ferntree Gully, Victoria, is a one-stop-shop for all your camping, caravaning, and motorhome needs.
